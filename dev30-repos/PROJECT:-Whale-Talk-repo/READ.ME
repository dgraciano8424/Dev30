# Whale Talk - JavaScript Loops Project

Translate regular English phrases into whale language by extracting vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and doubling the e's and u's. Built as part of [Parsity Dev30](https://parsity.io/dev30) JavaScript fundamentals course.

## The Challenge
- Input: `"P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney"`
- Output: `"EEAAAAEE"`

**Whale rules:**
- No consonants, only vowels (excluding y)
- Double all e's and u's
- Uppercase final result

## How It Works
1. Outer loop iterates through each character in input string
2. Inner loop checks if character matches any vowel → push to `resultArray`
3. Special if-statement doubles e's and u's before inner loop runs
4. `join("")` + `toUpperCase()` → final whale song
