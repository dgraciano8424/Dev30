# Meal Maker

A JavaScript program that randomly generates a three-course meal from a restaurant menu and calculates the total cost.

## What It Does

This program solves the problem of menu indecision. It randomly selects one dish from each course category (appetizers, mains, desserts) and returns a complete meal with pricing.

## Features

- Add dishes dynamically to any course
- Random selection using Math.random()
- Automatic price calculation
- Reusable menu system

## How It Works

The menu object uses three methods:
- `addDishToCourse()` - adds dishes to the menu
- `getRandomDishFromCourse()` - selects a random dish from a course
- `generateRandomMeal()` - generates a complete three-course meal
